            <h1><strong>Kridavyuha Contest Playbook</strong></h1>
            
            <h2><u>Joining a Contest</u></h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Add Credits:</strong> Ensure you have enough credits in your Kridavyuha wallet.</li>

                <li><strong>Register:</strong> Sign up for the contest before it enters the 'Open' state.</li>
                <li><strong>Entry Window:</strong> Contests enter the 'Open' state 30 minutes before the match starts. This is your window to join.</li>
                <li><strong>Trading Portfolio:</strong> Once registered, you receive 10,000 game points in your portfolio to trade players.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2><u>How a Contest Works</u></h2>
            <p>Every player in the contest has a <strong>base price</strong>, which fluctuates based on two factors:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Performance Factor:</strong> Player's in-game performance impacts their price according to predefined rules.</li>
                <li><strong>Purchase Rate Factor:</strong> Determined in the backend based on user sentiment.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3><u>Performance Factor</u></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Directly related to player stats (e.g., runs scored, wickets taken, strike rate, etc.).</li>
                <li>Real-time updates ensure price reflects current match performance.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3><u>Purchase Rate Factor</u></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Kridavyuha batches transactions per player in a contest within small time intervals.</li>
                <li>Net shares purchased per batch influence the player’s price.</li>
                <li>Ensures market sentiment affects pricing independently of in-game events.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3><u>Transaction Limits and Fees</u></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>There are only a limited number of transactions that a user can perform in a match.</li>
                <li>Every transaction is associated with a transaction fee, which will be displayed during the transaction process.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2><u>Key Rules to Remember</u></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Prices change dynamically, so act strategically.</li>
                <li>Game points are limited; use them wisely for maximum returns.</li>
                <li>Real-time updates allow for trading decisions based on both match performance and market trends.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Stay engaged, analyze the market, and make your moves wisely to maximize your contest earnings!</p>
